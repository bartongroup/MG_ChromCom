# The model

In our data we distinguish four states, marked by colour: blue, brown, pink, red. The model is going to be very simple. 

## States

* blue/brown (BB)
* pink (P)
* red (R)
 
## Transition rates

Transition  |  $t < t_1$  |  $t_1 < t <  t_2$  |  $t > t_2$
------------|-------------|----------|-----
BB->P   |  0  |  $r_1$  |  $r_1$
P->R  |  0  |  0  |  $r_2$

We need to consider $t_2$ as a free parameter or a dynamic parameter, that is, it happens at BB->P transition.
